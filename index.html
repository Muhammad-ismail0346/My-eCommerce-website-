         Based in Riyadh, Noon.com is a USD $1bn eCommerce shopping Marketplace that was founded by Mohammed Alabbar, the Chairman of Emaar Properties.
         The online portal offers an assortment of products including fashion, beauty, home & kitchen, babycare, groceries and electronics. It even features top brands like L’Oreal, Apple, Mothercare and more.
         Keeping up with the digital technologies across geographies and industries, Noon.com has up-scaled itself to be a digital marketplace relevant to consumers from all age groups.
         In 2017, the “Arabic-first” e-commerce platform rolled its operations in the UAE after noticing the country’s internet-friendly, digitally savvy population.
         The same year it partnered with eBay to reach a wider audience and offer a larger product range. In early 2018, Noon.com announced that it was set to enter the online groceries delivery market in China.
         Noon.com currently has a head office in Riyadh, and a warehouse the size of 60 football pitches in Dubai.
         Even though the eCommerce scene in Saudi Arabia is still booming, Noon.com is making the right business moves and paving its way to multiple industries and countries.
         How soon do you think it will become a USD $2bn eCommerce shopping website? Very soon, we would say!

            <li>Jarir Bookstore</li>
         </h1>
         Founded in 1979 as a brick-and-mortar supplier of books, office supplies, and educational aids, Jarir Bookstore has evolved to a thriving eCommerce business.
         Based in Riyadh, today it has expanded its product range to Children’s toys, Arts and Crafts materials, AV instruments, photography tools and electronic gadgets.
         In December 2018, Jarir Bookstore was awarded Primaduta, the highest award given by the Indonesian Government to those foreign entities that stay loyal to buying and developing imported products from Indonesia.
         In an effort to target millennials, it opened an Apple store in its Riyadh Panorama showroom recently, promising an exceptional shopping experience.
         Jarir Bookstore has survived the ever-changing business landscape for 30 years, and it will continue to thrive given how easily it adjusts to the disrupting technologies and evolving consumer patterns.

            <li>Wadi.com</li>
         </h1>
         <br>
         Saudi Arabia-based eCommerce business stands out among the rest because of the fact that one of its founders is a female, Kanwal Sarfraz hailing from Pakistan.
         Founded in 2015, Wadi.com grew six-fold its operations in just one year.
         After raising US$67 million, and subsequently setting a record for Series A funding in the Middle East, Wadi.com achieved operational profitability by late 2016 – within just two years after getting launched.
         Today, it offers a catalog of 550,000 products including fashion, babycare, electronics, and more. It is often called the “ultimate oasis of online shopping” because one can buy anything from under the sun at Wadi.com.
         Apart from being headquartered in Saudi Arabia, it has offices in Dubai and India, with a major plan to expand its India operations in the coming months.
         Wadi.com sells to major Middle-Eastern countries like Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.<br>
